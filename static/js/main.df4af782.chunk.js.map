The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring.The breed developed from pointing dogs originating in Spain (Spioenen) and arrived in The Netherlands via France in the 16th Century. In The Netherlands, these dogs were referred to as Partridge dogs. In the Province of Drenthe, these Partridge dogs were bred among themselves and not mixed with foreign breeds, as occurred elsewhere. Throughout the DrentÂ¿s history, the breed stood on three equally important pillars: versatile hunting dog, farmyard dog, and playmate to the children. It is fundamental to the Drent breed that he hunts all upland game and waterfowl, announces visitors to the home or farm (without showing aggression or fear), and is an excellent family companion. The Drent is used to hunt a variety of terrain and game. His adaptability makes him suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as waterfowl. Moreover, his work after the shot is exceptional, and he is a good retriever. These characteristics are innate, and the dog therefore needs little field training. Due to the dog's soft nature forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce visitors to the home and is often reserved towards strangers until the owner welcomes them, meaning the Drent may be shy in the beginning but never fearful. The dog is loyal and intelligent and, with proper upbringing, a pet of exceptional value on top of being a good hunting buddy.

The dogs had several names like \\\"Oyuki Terriers\\\" and \\\"Mikado Terriers\\\", and were kept by the Japanese as well as some foreigners.Around 1916, in the Nada ward near Kobe, a dog named Kuro meaning black in Japanese was born from an out-cross breeding from English Toy Terriers and a Toy Bull Terrier both imported from the Western countries. With careful selections of the breeding pairs out of these offsprings and the Kobe Terriers a very short-haired, slim, small terrier type dog was born which are today known as the Japanese Terriers. By 1930, their work with the breed helped develop a standard and was finally recognized by the Japan Kennel Club. The Japanese Terriers did not become widespread until 1940, when they were seen in most major Japanese cities. The demand for this breed skyrocketed when these cities demanded for a small, more active dog than large watch-dogs. However, the breed faced two instances throughout its history where they faced extinction later on: first during World War II, and then around 1948 when the Western breeds became more fashionable.

He is very sharp-eyed, owns a good sense of smell and aptitude, and works fast and efficiently.The Stabyhoun's independent nature was a deliberately bred characteristic by farmers who wanted a dog that could hunt independently for moles and rabbits. That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.     Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no \\\"surprises\\\" in store before calming down again.     This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby's build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an \\\"all-around\\\" dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing.

Overall, the breed presents a picture of streamlined grace and balance. A well-conditioned Weimaraner on point is a breathtaking sight.

This versatile dog will be happy by your side or participating in agility, coursing ability, herding or sledding.For centuries the Yakutian Laika was an irreplaceable and faithful assistant of a man in the conditions where the slightest demonstration of weakness was punished with death. It always received a respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless, its friendly nature doesnÂ¿t exclude the necessity of a certain amount of socialization, preferably at an early age. The Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in most cases itÂ¿s excited to acquire a new playmate. Human aggressiveness was considered by dog breeders as a major fault and was meticulously eliminated from its characteristics. The breed is endowed with a very sensitive nose and ears, which make it a rather capable watchdog. However, its barking is no more than a means to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance. This dog will most likely fail in the role of a guardian due to its friendly nature. Yakutian Laikas used to pull a narta (sled) in close collaboration with dozens of other dogs, so theyÂ¿re quite accepting of other dogs. The breed surely prefers to have one or several constant canine companions and can be introduced with few issues to the household with a pre-existing dog, although it should be performed with necessary caution. The second primary duty of this breed was hunting and it preserves much of its prey drive. That's why its communication with other small and average-sized animals should never go unsupervised.

They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.'Â The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.\",\r\n    \"group\": \"Sporting Group\",\r\n    \"images\": \"['https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Golden-Retriever-wading-into-a-lake.jpg']\",\r\n    \"max_expectancy\": 12,\r\n    \"max_height\": 24,\r\n    \"max_weight\": 75,\r\n    \"min_expectancy\": 10,\r\n    \"min_height\": 21.5,\r\n    \"min_weight\": 55,\r\n    \"temperament\": \"intelligent,friendly,devoted\",\r\n    \"ï»¿breed\": \"Golden Retriever\"\r\n}","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\n\nimport './BreedDetails.css';\nimport { MainNavigation } from '../../components/MainNavigation';\nimport BreedInfo from './BreedInfo';\nimport { FindNearestBreed } from '../../components/FindNearestBreed';\nimport { RecommendationPreferences } from '../../components/RecommendationPreferences'\nimport { breedDetailsMock } from '../../data/breedDetails';\n\nexport interface ILandings {\n  landings: any\n}\n\nfunction BreedDetails(props: any) {\n\n  const { breedName } = useParams<any>();\n\n  const [breedInfo, setBreedInfo] = useState<any[]>();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Fetch data from the API endpoint\n    axios.get(`http://127.0.0.1:5000/breeds/${breedName}`)\n      .then(response => {\n        // console.log('response', response.data)\n        // Extract breed name, description, and breed image URL\n        // Parse the JSON string into a JavaScript object\n        const responseData = response?.data\n        console.log('responseData - jashp', responseData)\n        // const formattedBreeds = response.data.breeds.map((breed: any) => ({\n        //   name: breed['\\u00ef\\u00bb\\u00bfbreed'],\n        //   description: breed.description,\n        //   imageUrls: JSON.parse(breed.images.replace(/'/g, \"\\\"\"))\n        // }));\n        // Set the formatted breed data to the state\n        const breedInfo = responseData?.breed_info?.[0]\n        console.log('breedInfo - hehe', breedInfo)\n        setBreedInfo(breedInfo);\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n        setBreedInfo(breedDetailsMock as any);\n      });\n  }, []);\n\n  console.log('breed info before return', breedInfo)\n\n  if (!breedInfo) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className='App'>\n      <MainNavigation cartItemNumber={0} />\n      <h1>Breed Details</h1>\n      <BreedInfo breedInfo={breedInfo} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default BreedDetails;\n","import { Home as HomePage, UserInfo, MatchBreeds, BreedDetails } from '../screens'\n\nexport const routes = [ \n    {\n        path: '/fur-ever-search-app/',\n        exact: true,\n        content: HomePage\n    },\n    {\n        path: '/fur-ever-search-app/user-info/',\n        exact: true,\n        content: UserInfo\n    },\n    {\n        path: '/fur-ever-search-app/match-breeds/',\n        exact: true,\n        content: MatchBreeds\n    },\n    {\n        path: '/fur-ever-search-app/breed-details/:breedName',\n        exact: true,\n        content: BreedDetails\n    }\n]\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Route, Switch, BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nimport { routes } from '../routes/page_routes'\n\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        {routes.map((route) => (\n          <Route path={route.path} component={route.content} exact={route.exact} />\n        ))}\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { ReportHandler } from 'web-vitals';\n\nconst reportWebVitals = (onPerfEntry?: ReportHandler) => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","\nimport { LOADING, MODE_TOGGLE, ADD_TO_CART, ADD_TO_LIKED_LIST, REMOVE_FROM_LIKED_LIST, REMOVE_FROM_CART } from '../constants';\n\nconst INITIAL_STATE = {\n}\n\nexport const ACTION_HANDLERS: any = {\n\n}\n\nexport default function AppReducer(state: any = INITIAL_STATE, action: any) : any {\n    const handler = ACTION_HANDLERS[action.type]\n    return handler ?
